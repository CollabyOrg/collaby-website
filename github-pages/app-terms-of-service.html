    <h1>Collaby Terms of Service</h1>
    <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p>
      By using Collaby, you agree to link at least one of your content platforms
      and provide access to its public data. You must also provide your email
      and password or opt-in for sign-in with Google, Apple or Facebook. Once
      you receive payment, your balance will appear on your Collaby account in
      USD dollars, and you may withdraw it in your local currency or use it for
      requesting collaborations with other users. You must satisfy the
      requirements for at least one linked platform in order to use the app.
    </p>
    <h2>2. User Responsibilities</h2>
    <p>
      You should not share your login credentials with anyone and are
      responsible for your account. It is recommended that you change your
      password regularly or use 2FA. You should not use the app for discussing
      illegal activities. When you accept a collaboration request, you must
      fulfill all requirements specified by the requester. If you do not meet
      all requirements, the requester may decline and appeal to Collaby for a
      refund. If that happens, you will not receive payment and your reputation
      will decrease. You must also regularly check for new requests and updates
      in your collaborations.
    </p>
    <h2>3. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>
      All content created and shared on Collaby is owned by the respective
      content creators. You retain all rights to your content, but by posting it
      on Collaby, you grant other users a non-exclusive license to use,
      reproduce, and distribute your content for the purposes of collaboration
      on the platform.
    </p>
    <h2>4. Data Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      We collect and store the following data: your device language, your email
      and password (managed and stored by AWS Cognito), your location as a
      content creator, the language spoken in your content, and platform stats
      related to your linked accounts (including Instagram, YouTube, TikTok, and
      Twitch). We only obtain data from platforms that you link to your account
      and only with your authorization following the OAuth 2.0 protocol. We use
      this data to match you with other content creators, display platform
      stats, and present your video to other users searching for collaborations.
      We do not share data with all AWS services, only with AWS Cognito, AWS
      DynamoDB, and AWS S3.
    </p>
    <h2>5. Liability</h2>
    <p>
      Collaby is not responsible for the quality, safety, or legality of any
      collaborations made through the platform. Users are solely responsible for
      their interactions and communications with other users. Collaby is not
      liable for any damages, including but not limited to, lost profits, data
      loss, or any other direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or
      punitive damages arising out of or related to your use of the app.
    </p>
    <h2>6. Dispute Resolution</h2>
    <p>
      In the event of a dispute between users, Collaby may offer mediation or
      arbitration services to help resolve the issue. If mediation or
      arbitration fails, the parties may take legal action as necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      These terms of service are subject to change at any time without notice.
      By continuing to use Collaby, you agree to the most current version of
      these terms.
